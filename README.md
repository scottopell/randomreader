# Random Reader

This program does nothing interesting. It reads random bytes and then does some
simple calculation with them and then sleeps.

It does this forever.

## Why?
Sometimes I need a nice simple binary that does enough work to be interesting,
but mostly just sits there. This fits that niche for me.

## Container?
```
docker pull ghcr.io/scottopell/randomreader:latest
```

[ghcr package](https://github.com/scottopell/randomreader/pkgs/container/randomreader)
